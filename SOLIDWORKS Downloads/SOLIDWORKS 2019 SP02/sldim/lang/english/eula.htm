		<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">The terms and conditions that follow and any other terms
				that are specific terms relating to identified Software or Online Services and
				published at <a class="xref" href="http://www.3ds.com/terms/ost" target="_blank">http://www.3ds.com/terms/ost</a>, hereby incorporated by
				reference, set forth a legal agreement ("Agreement") between you (either an
				individual or an entity), the end user, and Dassault Systèmes SolidWorks
				Corporation, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 175
				Wyman Street, Waltham, Massachusetts 02451 USA ("DS SolidWorks"), relating to
				different offerings consisting of (i) the computer software known as SOLIDWORKS<sup>®</sup> and certain other software licensed
				by DS SolidWorks (which may include, without limitation, the SOLIDWORKS Simulation
				line of analysis products, SOLIDWORKS Composer, and the SOLIDWORKS line of product
				data management products in all countries) and/or content, including databases, 2D
				and 3D models, in machine-readable form (the "Software") and/or (ii) online
				services, <em class="ph i">i.e.</em>, online access to and use of the Offering and
				other related services (the "Online Services") (collectively, the "Offering"). The
				term "Offering" includes and these terms and conditions also apply to (i) any
				updates or upgrades to the Offering that you may receive from time to time under a
				subscription service or other support arrangement, (ii) any add-in modules to the
				Offering that you may order and install from time to time, and (iii) software from
				third parties such as the Adobe<sup>®</sup> PDF library
				that is incorporated into the SOLIDWORKS Offering. You may not load or use the
				Offering in any computer or copy it without a right to do so from DS SolidWorks. DS
				SolidWorks hereby offers you a non-exclusive right to access and/or to download the
				Offering and to use it in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in this
				Agreement. You should carefully read these terms and conditions BEFORE opening the
				case that contains the Offering or installing and using the Offering or the Online
				Services. Opening the case containing the Software or installing and using the
				Software or the Online Services will signify your agreement to be bound by these
				terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, promptly
				return the case containing the Software and the accompanying items (including
				written materials) for a refund. For the Offering, this is a license agreement and
				not an agreement for sale.</strong></p>

		<p class="p">1.A. <strong class="ph b"><u class="ph u">Grant of License and Use
					Rights</u></strong>. DS SolidWorks grants to you a nonexclusive, nontransferable
			right to use the Offering and the printed and/or electronic user documentation
			accompanying the Offering (the "Documentation") in accordance with this Agreement. If
			you have paid the license fee for a single-user license of the Offering, this Agreement
			permits you to install and use one (1) copy of the Offering on any single computer at
			any time in the country in which you have your principal place of business or, if one of
			your branches has acquired the license from your reseller, in which this branch is
			located, <em class="ph i">provided</em> you have acquired the Offering from a DS
			SolidWorks reseller located in the country in which it will be used. The foregoing
			restriction with respect to the location of the reseller does not apply if (i) you
			purchase a license for an Offering from a reseller located in any country within the
			European Union or the European Free Trade Association and (ii) you are located in any
			country within the European Union or the European Free Trade Association. If you change
			computers, you must move the license from the old computer to the new/upgraded computer.
			You may move this Offering to another country with the prior written approval of DS
			SolidWorks. Such move, if approved, may be subject to payment of a fee. If you have a
			network license version of the Offering (an "SNL"), then at any time you may have as
			many copies of the Offering in use in the country in which it is licensed as you have
			licenses (see Section 1.A.b below). The Offering is "in use" on a computer when it is
			loaded into the temporary memory, <em class="ph i">i.e.</em>, RAM, or when a user is
			logged in. If the number of computers on which the Offering is installed or the
			potential number of users of the Offering exceeds the number of licenses you have
			acquired, then you must have an SNL version of the Offering installed to assure that the
			number of concurrent users of the Offering does not exceed the number of licenses
			acquired. License suites consisting of bundles of separate modules (such as SOLIDWORKS
			Professional) cannot float separately from each other (for example, where there is one
			SOLIDWORKS Professional license, Toolbox cannot be floated to one computer while
			PhotoView 360 is floated to a different computer). At the time of registration (see
			Section 9 below), you must inform us of the maximum number of potential users of the
			Offerings that you acquire. We recommend that you also inform us of the names of all
			potential users so that we can notify them of upcoming updates and other pertinent
			information. You will keep accurate and up-to-date records of the numbers and locations
			of all copies of the Offering; will supervise and control the use of the Offering in
			accordance with the terms of this Agreement; and will provide copies of such records to
			DS SolidWorks upon reasonable request. The use of Online Services is granted in a named
			user-based mode, <em class="ph i">i.e.</em>, is authorized for a single user identified
			with a unique username and password to use the Online Services from a single machine at
			any given time ("Named User"). You shall ensure that users of Online Services do not
			share or use the same username and password. Named User(s) may be replaced as necessary
			to reflect permanent personnel change(s), provided the number of individuals authorized
			to use the Online Services does not exceed the maximum number of rights granted to you
			for such Offering. Upon DS SolidWorks' request, you shall provide DS SolidWorks with a
			signed document listing (i) the number of Named Users, (ii) the type of use of the
			Offerings, and (iii) the locations and types of the systems on which Online Services
			operate or on which you have installed the Offering(s), as applicable. To determine
			usage by you, DS SolidWorks may provide you with one or more utilities, either included
			within the Offering(s) or separately, for the purpose of analyzing access right(s) and
			utilization. In such case, you shall provide, if applicable, the unedited and unmodified
			output file(s) and/or report(s) resulting from the operation(s) of such utility or
			utilities, along with a signed declaration that the file or files are representative of
			actual Offering(s) usage. You are responsible for implementing all reasonable means to
			monitor your compliance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>

		<p class="p"><u class="ph u">If you have paid the license fee for the SNL version
				of the Offering or are using SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard or Professional or SOLIDWORKS
				Manage Professional, the following additional terms apply to your license:</u></p>

		<p class="p">a. The SNL version of the Offering must be installed on a network server
			with a dongle or an embedded software security mechanism that will permit only the
			number of licenses you have acquired to be in use at one time. Additional licenses can
			be added to the network license from time to time as such licenses are acquired.</p>

		<p class="p">b. The network may include SNLs used in different countries as long as
			SNL is licensed for the country in which it is used. The required number of SNLs to be
			used in a particular country must be acquired from a DS SolidWorks reseller in such
			country. For example: SNLs managed from and installed on a server in the United States
			may be used by one person in Brazil and by one person in Mexico as long as one SNL was
			acquired in Brazil and the other SNL was acquired in Mexico. If, however, the server on
			which a SNL is installed is located in a country different from the country for which
			the SNL has been licensed, you should inform your DS SolidWorks reseller about this at
			the time of the order so that the SNLs can be administered properly. The foregoing
			sentence does not apply if (i) you purchase a license for an Offering from a reseller
			located in any country within the European Union or the European Free Trade Association
			and (ii) you are located in any country within the European Union or the European Free
			Trade Association.</p>

		<p class="p">c. In addition, the network on which the SNL version is installed may
			only serve licenses to client machines of the same legal entity or group located in the
			same global territory as the server. (For this purpose, DS SolidWorks considers there to
			be three global territories: the Western Hemisphere, Europe/Mid-East/Africa, and the
			rest of Asia/Australia). For example: All licenses used on a server located in the
			Western Hemisphere must be licensed for countries in the Western Hemisphere. <u class="ph u">Regardless of server location, you must always continue to comply
				with U.S. and U.K. export control laws</u>.</p>

		<p class="p">d. With respect to subsections (a) through (c) above, only subsection (a)
			applies to SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard or Professional licenses and to SOLIDWORKS Manage
			Professional licenses. Additional terms and conditions applicable to SOLIDWORKS PDM
			Standard or Professional licenses and SOLIDWORKS Manage Professional licenses are set
			forth in Section 1.C below.</p>

		<p class="p">You may convert your SNL to a Worldwide SolidNetwork license upon approval by DS
			SolidWorks, your compliance with DS SolidWorks' reporting and other requirements for
			license usage, and your payment of the appropriate Worldwide SolidNetwork license fee. A
			Worldwide SolidNetwork license may be "floated" to and used in any geography in the
			world (subject to the export-control laws of the United States and the United
			Kingdom).</p>

		<p class="p">When working with the Adobe<sup>®</sup> PDF
			software, you may embed copies of the font software into your electronic documents for
			the purpose of printing, viewing and editing the document. If the font software you are
			embedding is identified as "licensed for editable embedding" on Adobe’s website at <a class="xref" href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/embeddingeula.html" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/embeddingeula.html</a>, you may also
			embed copies of that font software for the additional purpose of editing your electronic
			documents. No other embedding rights are implied or permitted under this license. If the
			Offering is permanently installed on the hard disk or other storage device of a computer
			(other than a network server), then the person using that computer may also use the
			Offering on a portable or home computer while the original copy is not in use, <em class="ph i">provided</em> the Offering is under active subscription service (as
			such is described in this Agreement).</p>

		<p class="p">1.B. <strong class="ph b"><u class="ph u">Additional License Terms for
						eDrawings<sup>®</sup> Professional</u></strong>. SOLIDWORKS<sup>®</sup> eDrawings Professional software is a
			collaboration tool. SOLIDWORKS eDrawings Professional thus enables you, and DS
			SolidWorks grants you a license, to make copies of a portion of SOLIDWORKS eDrawings
			Professional along with model files you have created and deliver such files to third
			parties with whom you collaborate in order to enable them, among other things, to view,
			mark-up and measure your models.</p>

		<p class="p">1.C. <strong class="ph b"><u class="ph u">Additional License Terms for
					SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard or Professional and SOLIDWORKS Manage
				Professional</u></strong>. (a) DS SolidWorks licenses the SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional and
			SOLIDWORKS Manage Professional software on a Server + Client Access License [CAL] model,
			a Per Processor model for Microsoft<sup>®</sup> SQL Server™ 2008 R2 and prior versions, or a Per Core
			model for SQL Server 2012 and later versions. You may use the SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard or
			Professional software within a network or other multi-station/client environment, <em class="ph i">provided</em> you have one (1) SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard or
			Professional license per user concurrently connected to the SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard or
			Professional database or archive server (and, with respect to SOLIDWORKS PDM
			Professional licenses only, to the SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional Web server). The SQL
			Server 2014 Standard Edition, Runtime Restricted-Use Offering license contains other
			provisions regarding concurrent use. The terms of the SQL Server 2014 Express Edition
			license and the terms of the SQL Server 2014 Standard Edition, Runtime Restricted-Use
			Offering license are delivered with orders for, respectively, SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard
			software, SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional software and/or SOLIDWORKS Manage Professional
			software and are incorporated herein by reference. (b) SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional
			contains embedded software programs provided by Oracle Corporation and its affiliated
			companies ("Oracle") (the "Oracle Programs"), and notwithstanding the provisions of
			Section 1 above, Oracle or its licensor(s) retain all ownership and intellectual
			property rights to the Oracle Programs and are each a third-party beneficiary of this
			Agreement. The Oracle Programs are subject to a restricted license and can be used only
			with their associated application package and cannot be modified by you. Some of the
			Oracle Programs may contain source code that Oracle may provide as part of its standard
			shipment of such programs, and such code shall be governed by the terms of this
			Agreement. (c) Third-party technology that may be appropriate or necessary for use with
			some of the Oracle Programs is specified in the application program documentation or as
			otherwise notified by DS SolidWorks, and such technology is licensed to you only for use
			with the application package under the terms of the third-party license agreement
			specified in the application package documentation or as otherwise notified by DS
			SolidWorks and not under the terms of this Agreement. (d) You agree (i) to allow DS
			SolidWorks to audit your use of the Oracle Programs, (ii) to provide DS SolidWorks with
			reasonable assistance and access to information in the course of such audit, and (iii)
			to allow DS SolidWorks to report the results of such audit to Oracle or to assign to
			Oracle DS SolidWorks' right to conduct the audit (without any obligation or liability on
			Oracle to pay your or DS SolidWorks' costs incurred as a result of the audit). (e) You
			acknowledge that SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional and SOLIDWORKS Manage Professional each
			contains software and technical data that are subject to the export control laws of the
			United States or the United Kingdom, and you agree not to directly or indirectly export,
			re-export SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional and/or SOLIDWORKS Manage Professional, <em class="ph i">i.e.</em>, move SOLIDWORKS PDM Professional or SOLIDWORKS Manage
			Professional from the country in which you first licensed it, without the appropriate
			United States or foreign government licenses and the written approval of DS SolidWorks
			and its licensors.</p>

			Controller") as you determine the purposes and the means of the processing of any
			operation or set of operations (including, without limitation, collection, organization,

			proprietary rights notice or any disclaimer, and you shall reproduce on all copies of
			the Offering made in accordance with this Agreement, all such notices and
			disclaimers.</p>

		<p class="p">3. <strong class="ph b"><u class="ph u">Other Restrictions on Use</u></strong>.
			This Agreement is your proof of license to exercise the rights granted herein and must
			be retained by you. Other than as permitted under the rights grant in Section 1, you may
			not use any portion of the Offering separately from or independently of the Offering
			(for example, the Microsoft SQL Server software can only be used with the rest of the
			SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard or Professional Offering, provided such Offering is under the
			Server + CAL model or the Per Processor model) and other than for your normal business
			purposes and you may not provide access to or use of the Offering to any third party
			(other than a third party requiring access to SOLIDWORKS PDM Standard or Professional
			via a Web client or directly via a VPN); consequently, you may not sell, license,
			sublicense, transfer, assign, lease or rent (including via a timeshare arrangement) the
			Offering or the right to access and use granted by this Agreement. You may not use the
			Offering or the Documentation to develop application(s) for distribution to third
			parties unless you are a member in good standing of the SOLIDWORKS Partner Program or
			have entered into an agreement with DS SolidWorks for such usage/distribution. Other
			than as expressly set forth in Section 12, you may not install or use the Offering over
			the Internet, including, without limitation, use in connection with a Web hosting or
			similar service, or make the Offering available to third parties via the Internet on
			your computer system or otherwise. You may not modify or make works derivative of the
			Offering or make compilations or collective works that include the Offering, and you may
			not analyze for purposes competitive to DS SolidWorks, reverse-engineer, decompile,
			disassemble or otherwise attempt to discover the source code of the Offering, except as
			permitted under applicable law, as it contains trade secrets (such as the Offering’s
			structure, organization and code) of DS SolidWorks and its licensors.</p>

		<p class="p">4. <strong class="ph b"><u class="ph u">Subscription Service</u></strong>. If you
			acquire subscription service from your reseller for the Offering that you have licensed
			hereunder by paying the fee for such service, your reseller will provide you for such
			copy: on-line web access to download the latest updates to the Offering; all major
			upgrades for the Offering released during the subscription period; and telephone support
			services. Subscription service is automatically included with any Offering ordered under
			a yearly or quarterly term license and with the Online Services and cannot be terminated
			separately. From time to time, DS SolidWorks may re-distribute Microsoft software
			components as part of an update to the Offering. You are eligible for such Microsoft
			components and warrant that you will install them only if you possess a validly licensed
			copy of the Microsoft products to which they relate. The term of this service runs for
			one (1) year. It may be renewed from year to year thereafter by paying the appropriate
			renewal fee. Any Offering that is delivered as an upgrade or update to a previous
			version of the licensed Offering must replace such previous version. No additional
			license is granted: you may install only such number of updates as equal the number of
			subscription service fees for which you have paid. Support Services policy applicable to
			Online Services is detailed on the website <a class="xref" href="http://www.3ds.com/terms/support-policies" target="_blank">www.3ds.com/terms/support-policies</a> for the term of the services, <em class="ph i">i.e.</em>, one (1) year. It is subject to change; however, any
			changes will not become effective until the commencement of the immediately-following
			support services term.</p>

		<p class="p">5. <strong class="ph b"><u class="ph u">Privacy Policy</u></strong>. To obtain
			the Offering, you may need to provide DS SolidWorks with certain information about
			yourself, including, but not limited to, your name and email address. DS SolidWorks may
			also query your computer during the installation process to determine information
			including but not limited to whether you have SOLIDWORKS or other Dassault Systèmes
			products installed and the characteristics of the computer on which you will operate the
			Offering, such as the video controller or operating system. As a condition of
			downloading and using the Offering, you also agree to the terms of the DS SolidWorks
			privacy policy at <a class="xref" href="http://www.solidworks.com/sw/privacypolicy.htm" target="_blank">http://www.solidworks.com/sw/privacypolicy.htm</a>, which may be
			updated from time to time without notice. Information collected by DS SolidWorks in
			connection with your registration for the Offering may be stored and processed in the
			United States or any other country in which DS SolidWorks, its affiliates or its agents
			maintain facilities. Accordingly, by using the Offering, you consent to the transfer of
			such information outside of your country.</p>

		<p class="p">6. <strong class="ph b"><u class="ph u">Term</u></strong>. This Agreement
			remains in effect until terminated as provided hereunder or upon expiration, as follows:
			(i) for Offerings provided under term licenses granted in accordance with this
			Agreement, until the expiration of all such licenses, or (ii) for Online Services, the
			expiration of the contract term for which Online Services are ordered under this
			Agreement or the expiration of the subscription that you have paid for the Offering, as
			the case may be. DS SolidWorks may terminate the license and/or Offering granted herein
			immediately upon written notice to you (i) for justified cause, including, without
			limitation, breach of any provision of Section 1, 2 or 3 of this Agreement, or (ii) if
			you breach any provision of this Agreement and fail to cure such breach within fifteen
			(15) days of notice thereof.</p>

		<p class="p">You may terminate Online Services if DS SolidWorks fails to provide the Online Services
			in accordance with the applicable Service Level Agreement and such failure has not been
			remedied within thirty (30) days of DS SolidWorks' receipt of written notice thereof.
			Otherwise, you or DS SolidWorks may terminate any Online Services by providing notice to
			the other party at least thirty (30) days prior to the renewal date of the Online
			Services. Absent such notification, the Online Services shall automatically renew and be
			subject to the then-applicable Service Level Agreement. DS SolidWorks may change or
			modify the Online Services at any time. DS SolidWorks will not materially diminish the
			Online Services during the term of the Offering. Nothing in this paragraph shall require
			DS SolidWorks to continue to provide any portion of the Online Services if this would
			result in DS SolidWorks' violating the rights of any third party or any applicable
			law.</p>

		<p class="p">Upon the termination of the right to access and use the Offering granted
			hereunder, you will promptly cease all such use and return to DS SolidWorks or destroy
			all copies of the Offering and Documentation covered by such right as instructed by DS
			SolidWorks and shall no longer have access to the Online Services and to subscription
			service. If you terminate Online Services for noncompliance by DS SolidWorks of the
			Service Level Agreement, DS SolidWorks will reimburse you for any prepaid but unused
			recurring fees as of the termination date. This refund represents DS SolidWorks' sole
			liability and your sole remedy for DS SolidWorks' failure to provide Online
			Services.</p>

		<p class="p">The provisions of Sections 1D.b, 1D.d, 1D.e., 1E, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12
			and 13 of this Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement.</p>

		<p class="p">7. <strong class="ph b">Responsibility for Selection and Use of
				Offering</strong>. You are responsible for the supervision, management and control of the
			use of Offering, and output of the Offering, including, but not limited to: (1)
			selection of the Offering to achieve your intended results; (2) determining the
			appropriate uses of the Offering and the output of the Offering in your business; (3)
			establishing adequate independent procedures for testing the accuracy of the Offering
			and any output; and (4) establishing adequate backup to prevent the loss of data in the
			event of an Offering malfunction. <strong class="ph b">The Offering is a tool that is
				intended to be used only by trained professionals. It is not to be a substitute for
				professional judgment or independent testing of physical prototypes for product
				stress, safety and utility; you are solely responsible for any results obtained from
				using the Offering. Neither the Offering nor any of its components are intended for
				use in the design or operation of nuclear facilities, life support systems, aircraft
				or other activities in which the failure of the Offering or such components, or
				both, could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental
				damage.</strong></p>

					&amp; Disclaimers; Intellectual Property Indemnification</u></strong></p>

		<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">a. <u class="ph u">Limited Warranty</u>. DS
				SolidWorks warrants that the Offerings will be free of defects in materials and will
				perform substantially in accordance with the Documentation for a period of ninety
				(90) days from the date of receipt by you. DS SolidWorks also warrants that any
				services it provides from time to time will be performed in a workmanlike manner in
				accordance with reasonable commercial practice. DS SolidWorks does not warrant that
				the Offering or service will meet your requirements or that the operation of the
				Offering will be uninterrupted or error-free or that any Internet tool or service
				will be completely secure. DS SolidWorks' entire liability and your sole remedy
				under this warranty shall be to use reasonable efforts to repair or replace the
				nonconforming media or Software or re-perform the service. If such effort fails, DS
				SolidWorks or DS SolidWorks' distributor or reseller shall (i) refund the price you
				paid for the Software upon return of the nonconforming Software and a copy of your
				receipt or the price you paid for the service, as appropriate, or (ii) provide such
				other remedy as may be required by law. Any replacement Software will be warranted
				for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days from the date
				of receipt by you, whichever is longer.</strong></p>

		<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">b. <u class="ph u">Exceptions</u>. DS
				SolidWorks' limited warranty is void if breach of the warranty has resulted from (i)
				accident, corruption, misuse or neglect of the Software; (ii) acts or omissions by
				someone other than DS SolidWorks; (iii) combination of the Software with products,
				material or software not provided by DS SolidWorks or not intended for combination
				with the Software; or (iv) failure by you to incorporate and use all updates to the
				Software available from DS SolidWorks.</strong></p>

		<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">c. <u class="ph u">Limitations on Warranties</u>. The
				express warranty set forth in this Section 8 is the only warranty given by DS
				SolidWorks with respect to the Offering and Documentation furnished hereunder and
				any service supplied from time to time; to the maximum extent permitted by
				applicable law, DS SolidWorks and its licensors, including, without limitation,
				Adobe, make no other warranties, express, implied or arising by custom or trade
				usage, and specifically disclaim the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
				particular purpose and non-infringement. In no event may you bring any claim, action
				or proceeding arising out of the warranty set forth in this Section 8 more than one
				year after the date on which the alleged breach of warranty occurred.</strong></p>

		<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">d. <u class="ph u">Limitations on Liability</u>.
				You recognize that the price paid for the license to or right to access and use the
				Offering may be substantially disproportionate to the value of the products to be
				designed, stored, managed or distributed in conjunction with the Offering. For the
				express purpose of limiting the liability of DS SolidWorks and its licensors to an
				extent that is reasonably proportionate to the commercial value of this transaction,
				you agree to the following limitations on DS SolidWorks' and its licensors'
				liability. Except as required under local law, the liability of DS SolidWorks and
				its licensors, whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise,
				arising out of or in connection with the Offering or Documentation furnished
				hereunder and any service supplied from time to time shall not exceed the fee that
				you paid for such Offering in the twelve (12)-month period immediately preceding the
				cause of action that gave rise to such liability. In no event shall DS SolidWorks or
				its licensors be liable for direct, special, indirect, incidental, punitive or
				consequential damages (including, without limitation, damages resulting from loss of
				use, loss of data, loss of profits, loss of goodwill or loss of business) arising
				out of or in connection with the use of or inability to use the Offering or
				Documentation furnished hereunder and any service supplied from time to time, even
				if DS SolidWorks or its licensors have been advised of the possibility of such
				damages. However, certain of the above limitations may not apply in some
				jurisdictions. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, any legal action
				against DS SolidWorks must be filed with the appropriate judicial jurisdiction
				within two (2) years after the applicable cause of action has arisen.</strong></p>

		<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">e. <u class="ph u">Intellectual Property
					Indemnification</u>. DS SolidWorks will defend you against any claims made by a
				third party that an Offering delivered under this Agreement infringes a copyright in
				any country or a patent of the United States, Japan, or a member state of the
				European Patent Organization, and will pay all costs, damages and expenses
				(including reasonable legal fees) finally awarded against you by a court of
				competent jurisdiction or agreed to in a written settlement agreement signed by DS
				SolidWorks arising out of such claim, provided (i) you provide DS with prompt
				written notice of the claim, and (ii) Customer gives DS SolidWorks sole control of
				the defense of the claim and any related settlement discussions and provides
				reasonable cooperation in the defense and settlement of the claim.</strong></p>

		<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">If such a claim is made, or in DS SolidWorks'
				reasonable opinion an Offering is likely to become the subject of such a claim (or
				likely to be made), DS SolidWorks may at DS SolidWorks' expense, either secure the
				right for you to continue using the applicable Offering, modify it so that it is not
				infringing, or replace it with another program which is functionally equivalent. If
				none of the foregoing options is available on terms which are reasonable in DS
				SolidWorks' judgment, DS SolidWorks may terminate the licenses to the Offering
				and/or terminate the Online Services. For perpetual licenses, DS SolidWorks shall
				either refund or provide you a credit, at your option, in an amount equal to the
				corresponding one-time fee paid for the licenses, depreciated on a straight-line
				over three (3) years upon return or destruction of all copies of the affected
				Offering as certified by one of your officer. For Online Services or licenses that
				are not perpetual, DS SolidWorks shall refund all prepaid but unused fees paid
				hereunder for the affected Online Services or licenses.</strong></p>

		<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">DS SolidWorks shall have no obligation to defend or
				indemnify you against any claim related to (i) any modification of an Offering by
				anybody other than DS SolidWorks, (ii) the use of one or more Offerings in
				combination with other hardware, data or programs not specified by DS SolidWorks, or
				(iii) the use of corrective patches or Releases other than the most recent
			one.</strong></p>

		<p class="p"><strong class="ph b">This Section 8.e states DS SolidWorks' entire
				liability and your exclusive remedy for any claim of infringement of intellectual
				property rights.</strong></p>

		<p class="p">9. <strong class="ph b"><u class="ph u">Shutdown Feature</u></strong>. You
			acknowledge and agree that the Offering contains an automatic shutdown feature (the
			"Shutdown Feature") that, if activated, will render the Offering inoperable. The
			Shutdown Feature will automatically activate thirty (30) days after the Offering is
			installed unless an access code that overrides the Shutdown Feature ("Validated
			License") is entered. To obtain your Validated License, you must register with DS
			SolidWorks by providing DS SolidWorks electronically the information requested in the
			installation process. Upon receipt of the registration information, DS SolidWorks will
			issue you a Validated License.</p>

		<p class="p">10. <strong class="ph b"><u class="ph u">Export Rules</u></strong>. Export to
			you of the Offering and Documentation is subject to all applicable countries' export and
			re-export laws and regulations, including but not limited to the export control laws of
			the United States or the United Kingdom. DS SolidWorks and its licensors shall have no
			liability towards you if necessary authorizations, licenses or approvals are not
			obtained. You shall not export or re-export, either directly or indirectly, the Offering
			when such export or re-export requires an export license or other governmental approval
			without first obtaining such license or approval. You hereby warrant to DS SolidWorks
			that all Offerings ordered hereunder shall not be used in violation of any applicable
			export laws, including for proliferation of any nuclear, chemical or biological weapons
			or missile delivery systems, and shall not be diverted to any country, company or
			individual if prohibited by the applicable export laws of any country. You recognize
			that your data may be transferred to or stored in any country. You undertake to abstain
			from, and shall ensure all users abstain from, processing, storing or uploading on its

			You shall be deemed to be the exporter of your Data. DS SolidWorks may terminate this
			Agreement and all licenses and access to the Online Services hereunder upon written
			notice if you violate these provisions.</p>

		<p class="p">11. <strong class="ph b"><u class="ph u">Audit</u></strong>. During the term of
			this Agreement and for a period of three (3) years thereafter, you shall establish and
			maintain accurate information records relating to the use of the Offering, including,
			without limitation, the list and location of users accessing and using the Offering.
			When applicable, such information shall include destruction of the Offering and the
			measures put in place by you to protect access to and use of the Offering. DS SolidWorks
			shall have the right - at any time, at its own expense and under reasonable conditions
			of time and place - to audit and copy these records and/or your use of the Offering. You
			also hereby authorize DS SolidWorks to verify your compliance with the terms of this
			Agreement. For such purpose, DS SolidWorks may conduct an audit on your premises (or on
			the premises where the Offering is installed for your use) during normal business hours,
			in a manner that minimizes disruption to your business. DS SolidWorks may require you to
			provide it, or any third party that DS SolidWorks engages to conduct such verification,
			with machine access, copies of system tools outputs, or other electronic or hard-copy
			system information as appropriate and allow execution of all appropriate tools
			generating audit records. If the audit reveals unauthorized use of the Offering, you
			shall promptly pay to DS SolidWorks any amount(s) owed as a result of such unauthorized
			use at the Offering’s then-current list price. If such unauthorized use is five percent
			(5%) or greater of your authorized use with respect to the applicable Offering, then, in
			addition to you paying the applicable charges, you shall reimburse DS SolidWorks for the
			cost of such audit. By invoking the rights and procedures described above, DS SolidWorks
			does not waive its right to enforce this Agreement or to protect its intellectual
			property by any other means permitted by law.</p>

		<p class="p">12. <strong class="ph b"><u class="ph u">Third-Party Hosting</u></strong>. You are authorized to install and use the Offering
			remotely on computers operated by a well-established, reputable third-party service
			provider, and to appoint such service provider to operate the hardware and manage the
			Offering solely for you and on your behalf; <em class="ph i">provided</em>, however, (i) only duly

			written agreement with such service provider under which the service provider agrees
			that its access to the Offering is solely for the purpose of providing the services
			mentioned above to you and is otherwise subject to all of the restrictions and
			limitations contained in this Agreement; and (iii) such service provider is not a
			competitor of DS SolidWorks or any affiliate or subsidiary of DS SolidWorks. You
			acknowledge and agree that the service provider shall be deemed your agent. If you
			become aware of any actual or suspected unauthorized access, use or disclosure of the
			Offering, you shall immediately terminate the service provider's access to the Offering.
			You shall defend and indemnify DS SolidWorks against any claim, expense, judgment,
			damage or loss (including reasonable attorneys' fees) that arises out of or in any way
